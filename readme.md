This repo contains code for a [Spark](spark.apache.org) application defining a pipeline for intrusion detection (through supervised machine learning -- multiclass classification with Random Forest) based on ip flow data.

The dataset can be found [here](http://www.unb.ca/research/iscx/dataset/iscx-IDS-dataset.html), and it consists of several different types of well-known network attacks, such as DDOS and Brute Force SSH connections.
